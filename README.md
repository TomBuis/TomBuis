- 👋 Hi, I’m @TomBuis
- 👀 I’m interested in: learning R, especially applied to mixed effects models and item response theory
- 🌱 I’m currently: still learning R, reviewing stats (I did MA and PhD stats courses in psychology studies in the 90s at York U, Toronto), so, yeah I'm old now, but still keen on learning, especially these two: mixed effects models, item response theory. I am currently collaborating on a small part of a research project, contributing to the development of a self-report measure. I am hoping to continue with more projects once I am up to speed again.   I'm also an artist (drawing, painting - see IG @TomBuisArt if you are curious). I mention this because I have been doing art for 15 years, but I miss research too much to grow old without it, so I'm taking very soft steps toward reengaging here. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: nothing so far, but I tend to catch typos while I read text. It would be efficient if I could offer correction suggestions as I go, as a small favour to the author. Really the only reason I find myself here now is that I clicked on an "edit" button somewhere and it brought me here, but who knows, I often find myself taking happy wanderings.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can email me here: tbuis123@gmail.com. At this point, I don't really see myself doing anything apart from pointing out typos as a teeny little courtesy, since I seem to notice these when I read textbooks and papers. I hope to be more available as I find more efficiencies generally. So, anyway, hi.
